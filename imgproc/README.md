# imgproc directory

Here you could find functions relationed with image processing, the goal of this module is to isolate the 
image operations for the rest of the code

Convolutional kernel operations

  ## overview abou it
  
    Convolutional operation is a mathematical operation that is very useful when we want to extract features,
    or make a filter operation in the spatial linear domain but the usual convolution is a little bit different
    compared with the right mathematical definition, the right name of the operation that we apply in images is called linear spatial correlation
    so if you are been mathematical rigorous you aren't applying a convolution, you are applying a spatial correlation
